## Level 1 Study Plan: Python Functions

**Textbook:** A Practical Introduction to Python Programming by Heinold

**Overall Goal:** Understand the basic definition, usage, and arguments of Python functions.

**Study Time:**  Approximately 3-4 hours


**Module 1: Function Basics (1 hour)**

* **Subtopic:** Defining functions using the `def` statement.  Syntax: `def function_name():` followed by indented code block.
* **Subtopic:** Calling functions.
* **Subtopic:**  Using functions to avoid code repetition.
* **Page Numbers:** 129-130
* **Example:** The `print_hello()` and `draw_square()` functions from the text.
* **Exercises:** Create functions that:
    * Print your name five times.
    * Print a different shaped box of stars (e.g., a rectangle).
* **Important Notes:** Pay close attention to indentation; it's crucial in defining function blocks.

**Module 2: Function Arguments (1 hour)**

* **Subtopic:** Passing values (arguments) to functions.
* **Subtopic:** Using arguments within function code.
* **Subtopic:** Functions with multiple arguments.
* **Page Numbers:** 130
* **Examples:** `print_hello(n)` and `multiple_print(string, n)` functions.
* **Exercises:** Create functions that:
    * Take two numbers as input and return their sum.
    * Take a string and an integer as input and print the string that many times.
* **Important Notes:** Understand how arguments are assigned to variables inside the function.


**Module 3: First-Class Functions (Introduction - 1.5-2 hours)**

* **Subtopic:**  Functions as objects (can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments).
* **Subtopic:** Copying functions.
* **Subtopic:** Lists of functions.
* **Page Numbers:** 241
* **Examples:** Copying a function (`g = f`), creating a list of functions (`funcs = [f, g]`).
* **Exercises:** (Limited in provided text, more advanced exercises would be needed from other resources)  Try to write a function that takes another function as an argument and applies it to a list of numbers.
* **Important Notes:**  This section introduces a more advanced concept. Focus on understanding the core idea of functions as objects; more detailed exploration can be done in a later, more advanced study.


**Review and Practice (30 minutes - 1 hour):**

* Review all concepts and examples.
* Attempt additional exercises from other Python tutorials or practice platforms (e.g., Codewars, HackerRank).  These would need to be found externally as the provided text does not offer many.


This study plan is based solely on the provided text excerpts.  For a more comprehensive understanding of functions, additional resources and practice will be necessary.
