Here's a 10-question multiple-choice quiz on Python functions based on the provided text, targeting a beginner level:

**Instructions:** Choose the best answer for each question.

**1.  What keyword is used to define a function in Python?**
    A) `function`
    B) `def`
    C) `procedure`
    D) `func`
    **Correct Answer: B) `def`**  The text explicitly states that functions are defined with the `def` statement.

**2.  What is the purpose of a function in programming?**
    A) To make a program longer and more complex.
    B) To repeat the same code multiple times without changes.
    C) To break down a large program into smaller, more manageable parts.
    D) To solely perform mathematical calculations.
    **Correct Answer: C) To break down a large program into smaller, more manageable parts.** The text highlights that functions improve readability and maintainability by breaking up large programs.


**3.  In the function `def print_hello(): print('Hello!')`, what does `print_hello()` represent?**
    A) A variable
    B) A data type
    C) A function call
    D) A comment
    **Correct Answer: C) A function call** This line executes the code within the `print_hello` function.

**4.  What is an argument in a function?**
    A) The name of the function
    B) A value passed to the function
    C) The output of the function
    D) A comment within the function
    **Correct Answer: B) A value passed to the function** The text explains that arguments are values passed to functions.


**5.  In the function `def print_hello(n): print('Hello ' * n)`, what does the variable `n` represent?**
    A)  A fixed number
    B) A function name
    C) An argument to the function
    D) The return value of the function.
    **Correct Answer: C) An argument to the function**  `n` receives the value passed when `print_hello` is called.

**6.  The function `def draw_square():` (as shown in the text) primarily demonstrates:**
    A)  The use of loops in functions.
    B)  How to create user-defined functions.
    C)  The use of conditional statements within functions.
    D)  How to work with files in functions.
    **Correct Answer: B) How to create user-defined functions.** The `draw_square` example shows a basic function definition and its execution.

**7.  What is a benefit of using functions instead of repeating code?**
    A) Increased program size.
    B) Decreased readability.
    C) Easier modification and maintenance.
    D)  More complex debugging.
    **Correct Answer: C) Easier modification and maintenance.** The text explicitly mentions this as a key advantage.


**8.  The concept of "first-class functions" in Python means that:**
    A) They always return a numerical value.
    B) They can be treated like any other object.
    C) They cannot be passed as arguments to other functions.
    D) They must be defined before they are used.
    **Correct Answer: B) They can be treated like any other object.** This is the definition provided in the text.


**9.  In the example `g = f`, where `f` is a function, what does this statement do?**
    A) It creates a new function called `g`.
    B) It assigns the function `f` to the variable `g`.
    C) It calls the function `f` and assigns the result to `g`.
    D) It deletes the function `f`.
    **Correct Answer: B) It assigns the function `f` to the variable `g`.**  This demonstrates the first-class nature of Python functions.


**10.  What does the line `funcs = [f, g]` achieve, given `f` and `g` are functions?**
    A) It adds the functions `f` and `g` to a dictionary.
    B) It creates a tuple containing the functions `f` and `g`.
    C) It creates a list containing the functions `f` and `g`.
    D) It concatenates the names of functions `f` and `g` into a string.
    **Correct Answer: C) It creates a list containing the functions `f` and `g`.** This demonstrates the ability to store functions in lists.
