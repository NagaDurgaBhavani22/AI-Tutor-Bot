Here's a 10-question multiple-choice quiz on Python functions based on the provided text excerpts, focusing on first-class functions and function arguments:

**Instructions:** Choose the best answer for each multiple-choice question.

**1. What is a first-class function in Python?**
A) A function that always returns a value of type `int`.
B) A function that takes no arguments.
C) A function that can be treated like any other object (assigned to variables, passed as arguments, etc.).
D) A function that is defined within another function.

**Correct Answer: C**  First-class functions are objects that can be manipulated like any other data type in Python.

**2.  Given `def f(x): return x*x; g = f; print(f(3), g(3))`, what will be printed?**
A) 3 3
B) 9 9
C) 9 3
D) 3 9

**Correct Answer: B**  `g` is assigned the function `f`.  Therefore, `g(3)` and `f(3)` produce the same result.

**3.  What is the output of `funcs = [lambda x: x**2, lambda x: x**3]; print(funcs[0](5), funcs[1](5))`?**
A) 25 125
B) 10 15
C) 5 5
D) Error

**Correct Answer: A** This demonstrates a list of functions (lambda functions in this case). `funcs[0](5)` evaluates to 25, and `funcs[1](5)` evaluates to 125.

**4. The `int()` function in Python:**
A) Always rounds floating-point numbers to the nearest integer.
B) Truncates (removes) the fractional part of a floating-point number.
C) Cannot convert strings to integers.
D) Only works with integers.

**Correct Answer: B** `int()` performs truncation, not rounding.

**5.  What is the purpose of a function in programming?**
A) To make the code run faster.
B) To perform a specific computation or task.
C) To declare variables.
D) To define data types.

**Correct Answer: B** Functions encapsulate a set of instructions to achieve a specific goal.


**6. What does it mean to "call" a function?**
A) To define the function's code.
B) To execute the function's code.
C) To copy the function.
D) To delete the function.


**Correct Answer: B** Calling a function means executing the code within that function.

**7. Which of the following is a valid way to define a function in Python?**
A) `function my_func():`
B) `define my_func():`
C) `def my_func():`
D) `my_func():`

**Correct Answer: C** `def` is the keyword used to define a function in Python.

**8.  The `float()` function can convert:**
A) Only integers to floating-point numbers.
B) Only strings to floating-point numbers.
C) Integers and strings to floating-point numbers.
D) Only floating-point numbers to integers.

**Correct Answer: C** `float()` can handle both integer and string conversions to floating-point numbers.


**9.  What is the benefit of using functions instead of repeating code?**
A)  Makes the code run faster.
B)  Reduces code redundancy and improves maintainability.
C)  Increases code size.
D)  Makes the code harder to understand.

**Correct Answer: B** Functions promote code reusability and make modifications easier.


**10. A function that takes no arguments is called:**
A) A void function.
B) A null function.
C) A parameterless function.
D) An anonymous function.

**Correct Answer: C** While A and B are sometimes used informally, C is the most technically precise term.  D refers to lambda functions.
